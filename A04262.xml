            <p>Created by converting TCP files to TEI P5 using tcp2tei.xsl,
      TEI @ Oxford.

         </projectDesc>
         <editorialDecl>
            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,368 texts created during Phase 1 of the project (2000-2009), initially available only to institutions that contributed to their creation, were released into the public domain on 1 January 2015. The approximately 40,000 texts produced during Phase 2 (2009- ), of which 34,963 had been released as of 2020, originally similarly restricted, were similarly freed from all restrictions on 1 August 2020. As of that date anyone is free to take and use these texts for any purpose (modify them, annotate them, distribute them, etc.). But we do respectfully request that due credit and attribution be given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

And firſt as to ye perſonis, the pepill of God and ye natiounis thair enemeis to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gidder with chair prydefull perſute of Dauid &amp; Goddis maiſt not avill deliuerance. Is thair not now ane ſinceir profeſſioun of ye treuth amangeſt ws in this Ile oppugnit by ye natiounis about, haiteris of ye holie word. And do we not alſo as Iſraell profes ane onlie God, rewlit by his pure word allmerlie on ye vther part. Ar they nocht as Philiſtinis adoreris of legionis of Goddis, and rewlit by ye fooliſh traditiounes of men: Haue they not as ye Philiſtinis bene continuallie ye perſeweris, and we as Iſraell ye defenderis of our natiue ſoill and patrie: Nixt haue they not now at ye laſt euin lyke ye Philiſtinis cummed out of thair awin ſoilles to perſew ws and ſpred them ſelfis to that effect vpon ye greit valley of our ſeas preſumptuouſlie threatning ye deſtructioun and wrak of ws? Bot thridlie hes nocht our victorie bene far mair notabill then that of Iſraell: And hes not ye ane bene als weill wrocht by ye hand of God as ye vther? For as God by blawing in the toppis of ye trees with his michtie wind put ye Philiſtinis to flicht, hes he not euin in lyke maner by brangling with his michtie wind thair timmer caſtellis ſcattred and ſhakin them a ſunder to ye wrak of ane greit part and confuſioun of the haill: Now that we may reſembill Iſraell als weill in ye reſt of this actioun, quhat triumphe reſtis ws to mak for ye crouning of this bliſſit co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>medie: Cum to bring amangſt ws the Ark with all reioyſing. Quhat is ye Arke of Chriſtianis vnder grace bot ye Lord Ie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſus Chriſt quhom with ioy we bring amangeſt ws, quhen as receiuing with ſinceritie and glaidnes ye new Teſtament in the blude of Chriſt our Sauiour, in our hart we beleue his promeiſſis, and in word and deid we beir witnes thairto befoir ye haill warld, &amp; walkis ſo in ye licht as it becummis ye ſones of the ſame. This is ye worthieſt triumphe of our victorie that we can mak. And althocht thair will doutleſſie be mony Micholis amangeſt ws, let ws reioyſe and praiſe God for the diſcouerie of them, aſſuring our ſelf they wer neuer of ws ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>compting

For all they that gatheris not with ws they ſcatter. And let ws alſo diligentlie and warlie try out thes traftie Micholis. For it is in that reſpect that Chriſt re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>commendis vnto ws the wiſdome of Serpentis, not thairby to deceiue and betraiſe vtheris, (no: God forbid) bot to arme ws againſt ye deceit &amp; treaſoun of hypocritis that gois a bout to trap ws. And leiſt that thir greit benefites quhilk God hes beſtowit vpon ws be turnit be our vnthankfulnes in ane grea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter curs in ſeruing for teſtimonies at ye latter day againſt ws to ye procuring of our doubill ſtripis. Let ws now to conlude bring in ye Arke amangeſt ws in two reſpectis befoir mentio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nit. Seing we haue alreddy receiued the Goſpell, firſt by con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtant remaning at ye puritie of ye treuth, quhilk is our maiſt certane couenant of ſaluatioun in ye onlis meritis of our Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uiour: And nixt let ws ſo reforme our defylit lyues as be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cumis regenerat Chriſtianis, to ye greit glorie of our God, ye vtter defeacing of our aduerſaries ye wickit, and our vuſpeikabill comfort baith herr and ellis for euer.</p>
